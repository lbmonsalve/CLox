# clox

a [Lox](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) interpreter written in C.

"a single-pass bytecode compiler, a tight virtual machine interpreter for our internal 
instruction set, compact object representations, a stack for storing variables 
without heap allocation, and a precise garbage collector."
